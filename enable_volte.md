# Enable VoLTE for a Provider that is not supported

You can enable VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) on this module for unsupported providers OOB by adding certain files to the EFS and ensuring the execution of specific AT commands

Prerequisites: This has been tested only with the `dummy_IMEI_vfde.qcn` QCN file and the **T-Mobile\Vodafone DE AT.2** `config` file, which enables the `RJ-11` port even when in `VOICE` mode. Therefore, before starting, you need to erase your EFS and follow all the necessary steps, as outlined in the [recovery guide](https://github.com/stich86/ZTE-MF289F-Recovery/blob/main/recovery_brick_windows.md#restore-module-configuration-efs-and-nv-items)) and check if your SIM card has VoLTE enabled (ask your telco provider

If the module is in `VOIP` mode, just change it issuing these commands over `adb` session:

```
adb shell
cfg set voice_work_type=VOICE
cfg save
```

If it reverts back to `VOIP` mode after a reboot, update `custom_parameter` using these commands:

```
adb shell
mount -o remount,rw /usr/zte_web
sed -i 's/VOIP/VOICE/g' /usr/zte_web/web/copy/custom_parameter
```

Once you have successfully uploaded the EFS configuration, attach the module to Windows and open `EFS Explorer`. Copy the contents of the [`data_efs_per_VoLTE` folder](https://github.com/stich86/ZTE-MF289F-Recovery/tree/main/data_efs_per_VoLTE) folder into the `/data` folder of EFS

Open TeraTerm and connect to `NMEA` port, then run these commands:

```
AT+CGDCONT=2,"IPV4V6","ims" 
AT+CGDCONT=3,"IPV4V6","sos"
AT$QCPDPIMSCFGE=2,1
AT$QCPDPIMSCFGE=3,1
```

Verify that the APN and IMS configurations have been successfully applied by executing the following commands and checking the corresponding output:

**APN**
```
AT+CGDCONT?
+CGDCONT: 1,"IPV4V6","","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0
+CGDCONT: 2,"IPV4V6","ims","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0
+CGDCONT: 3,"IPV4V6","sos","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0

OK
```

**IMS Configuration** (note the "1" after APN ID)
```
AT$QCPDPIMSCFGE?
$QCPDPIMSCFGE: 1 , 0 , 0 , 0
$QCPDPIMSCFGE: 2 , 1 , 0 , 0
$QCPDPIMSCFGE: 3 , 1 , 0 , 0

OK
```

Restart module with the usual AT command `AT+CFUN=1,1`

When the module is back online, reopen TeraTerm on the `NMEA` port and check if the `IMS APN` is connected and has an assigned IP using the following command:

```
AT+CGCONTRDP
+CGCONTRDP: 2,5,ims,10.76.206.157,,,,10.178.76.2,10.178.77.194

OK
```

Now you can try make/receive call and check if the modem is still in 4G using the usual OpenWRT tools such as the excellent [3ginfo-lite](https://github.com/4IceG/luci-app-3ginfo-lite) by @4IceG

Here is a recap table with all the tests conducted by me and other individuals using this module. If you achieve success with another ISP, please feel free to open a pull request (PR) and add it:
